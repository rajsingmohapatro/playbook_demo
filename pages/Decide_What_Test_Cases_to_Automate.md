# Decide What Test Cases to Automate

There can be many permutations and combinations for a single test case, which can be leading to complex and unmaintainable test suite. Therefore, it is important to evaluate what test cases to automate beforehand.

Below are some type of tests that may provide good return on investment:

- High risk tests that are usually critical for applications
- Repetitive tests that run for multiple builds.
- Tests that tend to cause human error.
- Tests that require multiple data sets.
- Frequently used functionality that introduces high risk conditions.
- Tests that require complex computational steps.
- Tests that run on several different hardware or software platforms
  and configurations.
- Tests that take a lot of effort and time when testing manually.
- Tests to provide acceptable coverage over the various Test levels.
